# Impact of Venues on Property Pricing - Report
*This is a report on how the venues nearby a property affect on its price.*

## Introduction/Business Problem

Today, there are many real estate companies in the world. These companies look for the best opportunities to invest. Within these opportunities, we find projects that involve huge investments. The problem is focused on Santiago de Chile, where there was a social crisis just before the COVID-19 crisis. Economy in Chile is not quite stable, this is why real estate companies have to make sure to invest only in the most promising projects.

Given this context, it's important for real estate companies to know how the surroundings of a property affect on its price. This way, they can know where their investment will have the highest pay off. Also, if they know how much the presence of each type of venue affects the price, they could reach a better decision on where to build.

To better understand how this approach can help these companies look at the following example. We have location A and location B, both with apparently similar conditions. The difference between these locations are that one has a supermarket and a school nearby, while the other has a park and a gym nearby. So, we could say that all four of these venues are a good thing to have close to our home (lets assume that). But we don't know in which of these locations to invest. If we had a model that quantifies the value that each type of venue adds to a property we could decide between these two locations rather easily (considering that the rest of the factors are pretty much the same).

On the other hand, this is very useful if there is a plan for new venues to be constructed near an evaluated location. So the price of the given location is not yet affected by these. If we knew how much value is going to be added by them, we can estimate the value of our unbuilt properties adding the effect of the upcoming venues. This is indeed very useful information for our stakeholders (real estate companies).
